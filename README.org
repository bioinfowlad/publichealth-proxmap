Mapping Public Health Resources by Proximity

(Project for Dana Abbey)

Dana has a list of public health resources (clinics, libraries, etc) and their addresses in our NLM region. She wants to be able to map them all and check promity clusters to propose programs.

Will try this first on a static, Rmarkdown version but then move to make it a Shiny app.
